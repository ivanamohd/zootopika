            <td height="229" colspan="2"><p align="justify" class="style37">In all portions of its range, the Milky Stork is threatened by poaching and interference with colonies. The exploitation of eggs and chicks was identified as the principal threat to the continued survival of these colonies. It was thought that, along with Painted Stork, this species is one of the most favoured by local waterbird collectors due to the taste and manageable weight of its chicks. Throughout its range the species is threatened by habitat loss as a result of mangrove deforestation, tidal rice cultivation, fish and prawn farming, and human resettlement. In South-East Asia all large waterbirds are suffering reduction in available breeding sites through felling of trees providing nest sites and loss of foraging areas to urban and industrial development. The species has been listed on Appendix I of CITES since 1987. It is legally protected in Malaysia and Indonesia. Colonies need to be protected from disturbance and from egg or chick collection wherever possible. In some cases this will necessitate some form of breeding season surveillance, perhaps in conjunction with research or ecotourism, and certainly in conjunction with local education initiatives. </p>
              <p align="justify" class="style37">Interesting Facts:<br>
  •	These birds can be found in South East Asia. It forages on tidal mudflats, in saline pools, fresh water marshes, fishponds and rice-fields. Lost of natural habitat and foodsource has drastic effect on the birds' population.</p>
